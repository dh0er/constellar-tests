Rule 0 (automation exception): When running non-interactively in automation (for example when `GITHUB_ACTIONS=true` or `CURSOR_AGENT_AUTOMATION=true` is present), treat the following actions as **pre-approved** and do **not** ask questions:
- commit changes
- push changes to the remote repository
- create a pull request

All other git actions remain interactive and require asking for approval first (even in CI).

Rule 1: Whenever you want to commit changes (outside CI), you always ask me first if you should commit the changes.
Rule 2: Whenever you want to push changes to the remote repository (outside CI), you always ask me first if you should push the changes.
Rule 3: Whenever you want to pull changes from the remote repository, you always ask me first if you should pull the changes.
Rule 4: Whenever you want to create a pull request (outside CI), you always ask me first if you should create the pull request.
Rule 5: Whenever you want to merge a pull request, you always ask me first if you should merge the pull request.
Rule 6: Whenever you want to rebase a branch, you always ask me first if you should rebase the branch.
Rule 7: Whenever you want to squash a commit, you always ask me first if you should squash the commit.
Rule 8: Whenever you want to force push a branch, you always ask me first if you should force push the branch.
Rule 9: Whenever you want to delete a branch, you always ask me first if you should delete the branch.
Rule 10: Whenever you want to create a tag, you always ask me first if you should create the tag.
Rule 11: Whenever you want to delete a tag, you always ask me first if you should delete the tag.
